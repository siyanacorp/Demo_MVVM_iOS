// To provide a description for Demo_MVVM_iOSTests, you can include a comment block above the test class definition in the corresponding Swift file. Here's an example of how you can write a description for Demo_MVVM_iOSTests:
final class Demo_MVVM_iOSTests: XCTestCase {
    /**
     Setup with error
     * Put setup code here. This method is called before the invocation of each test method in the class.
     - Throws: `NSError`
     */
    override func setUpWithError() throws {}
    
    /**
     Tear down with error
     * Put teardown code here. This method is called after the invocation of each test method in the class.
     - Throws: `NSError`
     */
    override func tearDownWithError() throws {}
    
    /**
     Test example
     * This is an example of a functional test case.
     * Use XCTAssert and related functions to verify your tests produce the correct results.
     * Any test you write for XCTest can be annotated as throws and async.
     * Mark your test throws to produce an unexpected failure when your test encounters an uncaught error.
     * Mark your test async to allow awaiting for asynchronous code to complete. Check the results with assertions afterwards.
     - Throws: `NSError`
     */
    func testExample() throws {}
    
    /**
     Test performance example
     * This is an example of a performance test case.
     self.measure {
     * Put the code you want to measure the time of here.
     }
     - Throws: `NSError`
     */
    func testPerformanceExample() throws {
        self.measure {}
    }
